        <p>Today is my first day blogging. I figured I would share my Transgender Transition Journey. I first came out as a Transgender Male which means I am was born female but identify as male(and am transitioning to) in August of 2016. Shortly after coming out I talked to my doctor about Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT for short). I was blessed that my insurance (Medi-Cal/Medicaid) covers it because without insurance covering it, it is exspensive. I did have to get what is called an exemption for my insurance which was managed thru Anthem Blue Cross at the time but that was easy to get. For me my HRT comes in the form of liquid testosterone which I have to inject in my butt once a week.</p>
    
        <p>After I started HRT I applied through the courts for my legal name and gender change. For this I had help from the <a href="https://www.thegenderhealthcenter.org/">Gender Health Center</a> in Sacramento. After the required waiting time both were granted. Once I had the court order I took that to the DMV and was able to update my Drivers License. I also took the court order to the Social Security office and updated my information on my social security number.</p>

        <p>The next step for me is to have my gender reassignment surgeries. The first one I am going to have is a double mestectomy (breast removale). Before I can get that I need to have the surgery approved by my psychologist that is overseeing my treatment. Once approved I will have to travel to San Fransisco for the surgery as that is the only place that my Insurance currently covers my surgery at. The recovery time takes a full year to be able to completely return to normal activity but six months for the main recovery time.</p>
